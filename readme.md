## The heck is this?
Just a place to put my codes.

## Explanation behind time complexity and space complexity result
I found this website online -> https://www.bigocalc.com/ <br>
Paste the code here to and checkout the time and space complexity of any code/ algorithm and its possible explanation.

## Comments
These are written to explain myself the code. However I have written them in such a way, you can learn from it too. Well ofcourse if those are correct in the first place.

## Errors!
I suck at coding. So please pull request or raise an issue if you find any errors in my program or comments.
