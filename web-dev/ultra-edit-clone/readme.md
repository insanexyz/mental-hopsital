# Ultra edit clone

Original website: https://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/ultraedit-download-thank-you/

<br>

It is a clone of the website called ultra edit. <br>
Media query is not applied for the grid but not nav bar which breaks the website for smaller screen. This is because at this time I dont know much about making hamburger style menus hehe.

<br>

Also its not a 1 - 1 clone. Just a simple clone.

See ya
